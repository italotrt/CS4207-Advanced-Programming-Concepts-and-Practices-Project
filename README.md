# CS4207 - Blockchain Project
Advanced Programming Concepts and Practices - University Module

## Project
We are developing a blockchain application for a peer-to-peer network.
The goal of this project is to develop a platform where students can connect with senior peers for mentorship and guidance, in our case we are mainly focusing for co-op (internship) interview questions.
In this project we make use of smart contracts that automatically allow students to share their queries with each other.
